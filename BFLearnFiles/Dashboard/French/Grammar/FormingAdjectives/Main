Forming Adjectives In French
An adjective is a word which tells youmore about a noun.
In French, adjectives agree with the nouns they describe,
which means that they are masculine, feminine, singular or
plural to match the noun.
Many adjectives follow a regular pattern

Singular             Plural
Masculine  Feminine  Masculine  Feminine
grand      grande    grands     grandes

Adjectives which already end in -e ( with no accent )
have no different feminine form:

Singular             Plural
Masculine  Feminine  Masculine  Feminine
utile      utile     utiles     utiles

Adjectives wich already end in -s have no different
masculine plural form.

Singular             Plural
Masculine  Feminine  Masculine  Feminine
francais   francaise francais   francaises

Some adjectives double the last letter before adding an -e
for the feminine form.

Singular             Plural
Masculine  Feminine  Masculine  Feminine
bon        bonne     bons       bonnes

Some adjectives are irregular and you need to learn each
one seperatly.
The irregular forms are normally given in a dictionary in
the French-English section.

Singular             Plural
Masculine  Feminine  Masculine  Feminine
blanc      blanche   blancs     blanches
nouveau    nouvelle  nouveaux   nouvelles
