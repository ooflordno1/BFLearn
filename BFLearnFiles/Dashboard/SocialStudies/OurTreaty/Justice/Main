Justice
In 1830 Captain Stewart got involved in a Maori conflict between 2 chiefs. 
Pakeha shouldnâ€™t have gotten involved. 
In 1831, 13 Maori chiefs signed a petition to Britain.
It said: 
Save us from foreign threats ( America and France ) 
Save us from the bad behaviour of the British people who live and visit NZ. 
Save us from the teasing of other tribes. 
They chose to send it to Britain because: 
Most Pakeha in NZ were from Britain. 
Maori thought they had a close relationship with Britain. 
Missionaries said the British crown had a fatherly/motherly relationship. 
When Britain received the petition they sent James Busby, to represent NZ. 
He was called the British Resident.
On 17 May 1833 James went ashore to Paihia where missionary Henry Williams lived.
At this time James was 33 years old.
James told the chiefs he was there to:
Protect Pakeha and Maori
Protect British trade with NZ
Set up British influence
Poor James:
He and his boss the Richard Bourke Governor of South Whales did not get on well.
It took months for letters to go between Australia and New Zealand.
He had to spend a lot of his poor salary on buying presents for chiefs
