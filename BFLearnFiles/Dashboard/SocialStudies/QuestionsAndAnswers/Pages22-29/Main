Why did Britain need to make a treaty with Maori?
Britain needed to make a treaty with Maori to inforce British laws on the Pakeha that lived there
In 1840 most of the 2000 Pakeha who lived in New Zealand were British.
Because of how many British people were living in New Zealand, 
the British government was concerned that some were breaking British law.
This is why the British government needed to make a treaty with Maori.

Explain why Maori viewed the treaty differently from Pakeha.
Maori viewed the treaty differently from Pakeha is because the Maori and the English
versions of the Treaty meant different things.
There were words in English that didn't convey the same meaning in Maori.
An example of this is in the First Article.
The English version said that the chiefs give sovereignty to the crown
However, the Maori language did not have a word for sovereignty.
Instead it translated to governorship.
If it was translated as sovereignty or a more similar word like authority ( mana )
or power to rule ( rangatiratanga ), probably no chiefs would have signed.

Why did Maori chiefs sign Britain's treaty?
