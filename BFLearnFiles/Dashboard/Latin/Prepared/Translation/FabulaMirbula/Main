Fabula Mirbula
Many friends were dining with Caecilius.
Felix was there also.
All the friends praised the cook, because the dinner was very good.
After they all dined, Caecilius shouted, "Where is Decens? Decens is not here."
Then Caecilius sent Clemens out of the house.
The slave looked for Decens through the city.
After the slave departed from the house, Felix drained his winecup.
Then the freedman told an extraordinary story:
"One day my friend was leaving the city.
It was night, but the full moon was shining.
The friend was hurrying through the street, where the forest was,
and suddenly caught sight of a centurion.
My friend greeted the centurion.
However the centurion said nothing.
Then the centurion took off his tunic.
Look! The centurion vanished.
A huge wolf suddenly appeared.
My friend was very afraid.
The huge wolf howled and hurried into the forest.
The tunic was lying on the street.
The friend carefully looked at the tunic.
Look! The tunic was made of stone.
Then the friend understood the truth.
The centurion was a warewolf.
