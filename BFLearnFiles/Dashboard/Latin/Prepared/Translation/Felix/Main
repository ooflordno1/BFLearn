Felix
Many Pompeiians were drinking wine in the inn.
Clemens entered the inn.
Suddenly Clemens shouted "Felix!"
Happily Clemens greeted Felix.
Felix was a freedman.
Clemens invited Felix to the house.
Clemens and Felix entered the house.
Clemens looked for Caecilius and Metella.
Caecilius was writing in the study.
Metella was sitting in the garden.
Caecilius and Metella hurried to the hall and greeted Felix.
After Quintus entered the hall, Felix looked at the young man.
The freedman was very moved.
He was almost crying; but he was smiling.
Then Clemens hurried to the kitchen.
Grumio was sleeping in the kitchen.
Clemens woke up the cook and told the whole story.
Because the cook was happy, he prepaired a very good dinner.
