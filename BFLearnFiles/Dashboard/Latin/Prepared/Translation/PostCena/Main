Post Cena
After Caecilius explained the matter, all of the friends were silent.
Soon they said "Goodbye" and left the house.
They were nervously proceeding through the street.
No stars were shining. There was no moon in the sky.
The friends heard nothing, because the streets were deserted.
The friends were proceeding along the street, because they were afraid of the ghost.
Suddenly a cat howled.
The friends were very afraid.
Terrified, they all rushed through the city, because
they were in dispear of their lives.
They made an extraordinary uproar.
Many Pompeiians were worried, because they heard the uproar.
However, Caecilius did not hear the uproar,
because he was sleeping in the bedroom.
