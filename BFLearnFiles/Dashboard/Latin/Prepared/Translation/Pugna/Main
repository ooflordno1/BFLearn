Pugna
Clemens was walking in the fourm. A very large crowd was in the fourm.
Slaves and maids were buying food. Many bakers were selling bread.
A poet was reciting. A Greek merchant was having an argument with a farmer.
The angry merchant was demanding money. Suddenly the farmer hit the Greek,
because the Greek was blaming the farmer. Pompeiians were laughing and
encouraging the farmer. After he heard the uproar, Clemens hurried to the fight.
At last the farmer overpowered the merchant and chased him out of the fourm.
The Pompeiians praised the farmer.
